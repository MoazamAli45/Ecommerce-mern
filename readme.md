# MERN Stack Ecommerce Project

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack ecommerce project. It includes both frontend and backend components for building an online ecommerce platform.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Frontend

1. First, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   cd frontend

2. Install the frontend dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the frontend development server:
   npm run dev

This will start the React development server and open the app in your default web browser.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   cd backend

2. Install the backend dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the backend server:
   npm start

This will start the Node.js server for the backend, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:YOUR_BACKEND_PORT` (default is 3000).

## Usage

Once the frontend and backend servers are up and running, you can start building your ecommerce platform. This project serves as a starting point and can be customized further to meet your specific requirements.

1. Configure environment variables: Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template and set the required values.
2. Access the application: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to use Ecommerce.
